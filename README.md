# Webhook Spy Script

## Overview

This repository contains a discontinued and unmaintained script originally developed by Emplic. The code is provided in its obfuscated state for archival and educational reference only. The script is non-functional in current environments and should not be used for any operational purposes.

## Status Notice

This project is discontinued. No further development, updates, or maintenance will be provided. The script is incompatible with current systems and exists only as a historical artifact for technical study.

## Important Disclaimers

The source code is heavily obfuscated and cannot be deobfuscated through conventional means. Reverse engineering attempts will not yield readable or functional code. The obfuscation is permanent and irreversible.

This script is provided solely for educational analysis of obfuscation techniques and historical reference. It is not intended for use, modification, or deployment in any environment. The functionality described in its original purpose is no longer operational.

## Usage Restrictions

Any attempt to use, modify, or redistribute this code for active purposes is strictly prohibited. The script exists only as a case study in code obfuscation and legacy script preservation.

## Original Context

This script was created during a specific period of Discord API interaction. All related APIs, endpoints, and services it once interacted with have since been updated, deprecated, or secured, rendering the script completely non-functional.

## Final Note

This repository is locked in its current state. No issues will be addressed, no pull requests will be reviewed, and no support will be provided. It serves exclusively as an example of legacy code preservation.
