## Webhook Spy v3

This repository contains the legacy build of **Webhook Spy v3**, a specialized tool originally developed for monitoring and managing webhook interactions. The project is currently maintained as a technical archive, representing a specific era of API interaction and script protection.

The implementation focuses on high-level obfuscation and secure logic handling. It is preserved here for historical reference, technical analysis, and study of legacy code structures.

### Status Notice

* **Discontinued:** This project is no longer under active development.
* **Unmaintained:** No further updates, patches, or bug fixes will be provided.
* **Non-functional:** Due to updates in external APIs and security protocols, the script is no longer operational in current environments.

### Technical Details

* **Obfuscation:** The source code is heavily obfuscated using irreversible transformation techniques. It cannot be deobfuscated or restored to a human-readable state through conventional means.
* **Integrity:** The obfuscation is a permanent feature of this release. Any attempts to modify or reverse-engineer the logic will result in a non-functional script.
* **Compatibility:** All endpoints and services previously utilized by this script have been deprecated or secured, rendering the tool obsolete.

### Notes

* Provided strictly for educational and archival purposes.
* Intended for the study of advanced code protection and obfuscation patterns.
* Not intended for deployment, modification, or active use.
* No support or documentation will be provided for implementation.
